UserStory:
As a user, I can click on a settings icon in the bottom and setup a cloud Sync option.
This option will be WebDAV. I can enter the URL, username, and password.
Before saving the settings, I can click on "Check" or "Verify" to see if my settings work.
After saving these settings, the app will use WebDAV to store the notes.

Open for discussion:
Does it make sense to copy / backup the notes to WebDAV or use it as only place to store?
